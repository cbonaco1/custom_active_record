## ActiveRecordLite

This application is a from-scratch implementation of an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), with features based on
the ActiveRecord ORM used in the Rails web framework. I completed this project
in order for me to gain a better understanding of how ORMs and ActiveRecord work.
A SQLite database representing a music label inventory is included in order
to test this implementation. The schema for the music database can be viewed [here]
