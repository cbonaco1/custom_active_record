## ActiveRecordLite

This application is a custom implementation of the ORM ActiveRecord used in
the Rails web framework. This code was written from scratch in order
for me to gain a better understanding of how ORMs and ActiveRecord work.
A SQLite database representing a music label inventory is included in order
to test this implementation. The scheme for the music database can be viewed [here]
